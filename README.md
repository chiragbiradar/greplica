Does your coding agent spend 5 minutes just grepping around when you give it a complex task?

That's because it is re-learrning context. Every new session, your agent wastes tokens and time building context on work it already did. And still misses important facts.

**Greplica** explores your repo structure, code and session transcripts (fully local, no telemetry) to give your agent a persistent, maintained memory it can query before exploring.

---

## Agent Quick Start

Most users should not install Greplica by hand. Paste this into your coding agent from inside the repo you want Greplica to remember.

Greplica requires Node.js 22-26.

`````txt
Install Greplica for this repo.

Run:

```bash
npm install -g greplica
greplica install --platform <codex|claude|opencode> --embedding local
```

Use the platform matching this agent. Do not manually copy skills. After installation, summarize the installer output, including skills, embedding mode, whether hooks were installed, and whether I need to restart or trust hooks.

Before running install or bootstrap, ask me one question:
"Should I use the last five prior sessions for this same repo to create richer Greplica memory?"

Recommend yes, but do not read old transcripts deeply until I answer.

Then bootstrap shallow memory for this repo:
- Prefer using the `greplica-bootstrap` skill.
- If the skill is not visible until restart, read the installed `greplica-bootstrap/SKILL.md` file and follow it directly.
- Create, validate, and apply the bootstrap proposal.
- Keep bootstrap output brief: give a one-sentence summary of what this repo does and say baseline memory was applied.

If I opted into prior-session learning:
- Find the five most recent prior sessions for this same repo and platform.
- Candidate locations: Codex `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`; Claude Code `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`.
- For OpenCode, tell me transcript backfill is not supported yet.
- Show me the five selected transcripts before bundling them: title if available, date/time, path, and why each matched this repo.
- Since I already opted in, continue without asking a second confirmation and run:

```bash
greplica transcript bundle --platform <codex-or-claude> --file <path-1> --file <path-2> --file <path-3> --file <path-4> --file <path-5> --out .greplica-transcript-backfill.md
```

- Then use the `greplica-fast-session-bootstrap` skill on `.greplica-transcript-backfill.md`.
- After apply, show exactly three compact, high-signal memories in this style:

```markdown
Applied transcript backfill to working memory: .greplica-transcript-backfill.md

Three useful things I learned from your previous sessions:

1. **<short title>**
   <specific stored memory>.
   Why it matters: <why this helps the next session>.
   Backed by: <session/code evidence>; connected to <component/flow>.
```

Then tell me how to use Greplica:
- Tell me that during work, the agent can use `greplica graph context "<question about the current task>"` to fetch relevant repo context, including prior working memory, before broad manual exploration.
- Tell me that near the end of a useful session, I should run "Use greplica-update-working-memory for this session." so decisions, changed flows, constraints, and follow-up work are stored.
- Tell me that OpenAI embeddings are also available later by rerunning `greplica install --platform <codex-or-claude-or-opencode> --embedding openai`.
- IMPORTANT: tell me that hooks and installed skills are the primary integration. Add a short AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md instruction only if hooks are unavailable, not accepted, or I want extra repo-local guidance.
`````

After that, the normal onboarding flow is:

| Step | Ask your agent | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Paste the prompt above | Installs the CLI, installs the matching agent integration, and reports hooks/skills status. |
| 2 | `Use greplica-bootstrap for this repo.` | Creates the first repo memory map. |
| 3 | Optional prior-session learning | Shows five same-repo transcripts, bundles them, and stores three high-signal memories. |
| 4 | Work normally | The agent can query `greplica graph context "<question>"` before broad exploration. |
| 5 | Accept hooks, or run `Use greplica-update-working-memory for this session.` manually | Durable decisions, constraints, changed flows, and follow-ups are saved. |

To visualise your current memory in browser, run:

```bash
greplica graph view
```

---

## How It Works

Greplica stores engineering context in a local SQLite database as a structured knowledge graph:


| Object        | What it represents                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Component** | A distinct code module or subsystem, with a file anchor pointing where to look                       |
| **Flow**      | A workflow or process that spans multiple components                                                 |
| **Claim**     | A durable fact, decision, constraint, gotcha, or task linked to the components or flows it describes |
| **Edge**      | A typed relationship: `about`, `touches`, `contains`, `supersedes`, `evidenced_by`                   |


When your agent asks `greplica graph context "<question>"`, Greplica runs a hybrid retrieval pipeline - combining vector similarity, BM25 keyword scoring, and graph adjacency boosts - and returns a concise Markdown summary the agent can act on immediately.

---

## What the Agent Actually Sees

Running `greplica graph context "how does proposal apply work?"` outputs:

```markdown
# Graph Context

Query: how does proposal apply work?

## Components

- `component.knowledge_graph_service` Knowledge Graph Service
  Anchor: `libs/knowledge-graph/service.ts`
- `component.sqlite_repository` SQLite Repository
  Anchor: `libs/storage/sqlite/repository.ts`

## Flows

### Proposal Apply

ID: `flow.proposal_apply`

Claims:
- `claim.apply_validates_before_writing` (fact, code_verified): applyProposal validates the proposal before writing any records.
- `claim.memory_commits_chain_with_parent` (fact, code_verified): Each memory commit stores a reference to its predecessor.

## Other Relevant Claims

- `claim.apply_prints_commit_scope_and_counts` (fact, code_verified): proposal apply prints the memory commit ID, scope ID, and created object counts.
```

The agent gets the relevant file anchors, the decision trail, and the constraints - without reading the whole codebase.

## Normal Session Workflow


| When                    | Ask your agent                                         | What happens                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before starting a task  | (automatic when hooks/agent guidance are active)       | Agent runs `greplica graph context "<task>"` before broad file exploration |
| During work             | Agent uses context to navigate                         | Relevant components, flows, and past decisions surface immediately         |
| End of a useful session | `Use greplica-update-working-memory for this session.` | Decisions, changed flows, constraints, and follow-up work are saved        |


---

## Quick Start (manual)

### 1. Install the CLI

Greplica requires Node.js 22-26.

```bash
npm install -g greplica
```

### 2. Install for your coding agent

Run exactly one of these from inside the repository you want Greplica to remember:

```bash
# Claude Code
greplica install --platform claude --embedding local

# Codex
greplica install --platform codex --embedding local

# OpenCode
greplica install --platform opencode --embedding local
```

This copies the Greplica agent skills, configures local embeddings (no API key needed), and initializes the memory database.

### 3. Restart or trust hooks if needed

After install, restart your coding agent if the new skills or hooks do not appear immediately. If your agent asks you to trust or accept the installed hooks, accept them for this repo.

Hooks record session activity and attempt background working-memory updates. If hooks are unavailable or not accepted, manually ask the agent to use `greplica-update-working-memory` near the end of useful sessions. Add a short `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` instruction only if you want extra repo-local guidance.

### 4. Bootstrap memory for this repository (once)

Ask your agent:

```
Use greplica-bootstrap for this repo.
```

The agent reads your repository shallowly - README, config files, key entrypoints, type definitions - and writes a structured memory proposal. After validation and apply, the graph is ready.

### 5. Optionally backfill from prior sessions

Ask your agent to find five recent prior sessions for this repo and show you the selected transcript paths before it reads them deeply. If you already asked it to use prior sessions, it should continue from the shown list without asking a second confirmation.

Candidate locations:

- Codex: `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`; prefer transcripts whose metadata `cwd` matches this repo.
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-current-cwd>/*.jsonl`; if needed, fall back to `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` and filter by transcript metadata `cwd`.
- OpenCode: transcript backfill is not supported yet.

Bundle them:

```bash
greplica transcript bundle --platform codex|claude --file <path> [--file <path>...] --out .greplica-transcript-backfill.md
```

Then ask:

```
Use greplica-fast-session-bootstrap on .greplica-transcript-backfill.md.
```

The skill reads the bundle, extracts durable decisions/gotchas/rejected approaches/follow-up work, validates and applies the proposal, then shows three compact memories that demonstrate what Greplica learned.

---

## What Gets Stored

Greplica is for context that is too detailed for an always-read prompt but too important to rediscover from scratch:

- **Architecture and service boundaries** - which module owns what, where boundaries are enforced
- **Implementation decisions** - why the code is shaped the way it is
- **Workflow behavior** - how commands and flows work across multiple components
- **Repo-specific gotchas** - edge cases and non-obvious behaviors that caused bugs
- **Constraints and rejected alternatives** - what not to do, and why
- **Follow-up tasks** - work that was deferred, not forgotten

The goal is not to replace source code or documentation. It is to give agents a durable map of what matters and where to look next.

## Embedding Options


| Mode            | Command flag         | Requires         | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Local (default) | `--embedding local`  | Nothing          | Runs `all-mpnet-base-v2` in-process via HuggingFace Transformers. First query downloads the model (~~420MB) and caches it under `~~/.greplica/models`. |
| OpenAI          | `--embedding openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Uses `text-embedding-3-small`. Better retrieval quality, requires network access per query.                                                            |


Switch at any time by rerunning `greplica install` with the new flag.

---

## Commands

```bash
greplica install --platform codex|claude|opencode --embedding local|openai
greplica config
greplica doctor [--check-embeddings]
greplica graph read
greplica graph context "<query>" [--debug]
greplica graph audit anchors
greplica graph view [--out <file>] [--no-open]
greplica graph export <dir>
greplica transcript bundle --platform codex|claude --file <path> [--file <path>...] --out <bundle.md>
greplica proposal validate <proposal.json>
greplica proposal apply <proposal.json>
```

- `greplica graph context "<query>"` - returns Markdown for agent use. Add `--debug` for the full retrieval payload with ranking signals.
- `greplica graph read` - prints the current graph view: all components, flows, claims, sources, and edges in scope.
- `greplica graph view` to visualise the current memory in a local HTML, opens in your default browser. Use `--out` to choose where the file is written; by default it goes to a temp path.
- `greplica transcript bundle` - converts one or more Codex or Claude Code JSONL transcripts into a sanitized Markdown bundle for `greplica-fast-session-bootstrap`.
- `greplica doctor` - verifies installation and diagnoses embedding configuration failures. Not a required preflight before every command.
- `greplica install` prepares repo memory state; normal repo commands require install first.

## Evals and Benchmarks

Greplica includes evals for the workflows that matter most:

- bootstrapping repo memory
- graph context retrieval
- working-memory updates from real sessions
- proposal validation and apply behavior

The search eval scores `greplica graph context` retrieval with `Precision@10`, `Recall@10`, `MRR@10`, `nDCG@10`, and `GradeRecall@10` over 34 realistic task-sentence queries against a deep synthetic fixture.


| Eval                          | Latest local result   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `npm run eval:search-current` | Passed, `80.59 / 100` |
| `P@10`                        | `0.550`               |
| `R@10`                        | `0.782`               |
| `MRR@10`                      | `0.985`               |
| `nDCG@10`                     | `0.802`               |
| `GradeRecall@10`              | `0.828`               |


Broader context-retrieval benchmarking, including SWE-Context benchmark work, is ongoing and showing promising early results. We will publish those numbers when the harness and methodology are stable enough to compare fairly.
